# Tip Calculator

## Isabel Gallegos

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [X] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [X] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [X] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [X] Custom colors palette selected.
* [X] Emojis to indicate tip amount.
* [X] Split total based on number of guests.

## Notes

While I didn't face any serious challenging implementing the different components
of the app, it took me a little bit of time to actually understand how the different
parts of the app work together. For example, when I added the functionality to
split the bill between multiple people, it took a little more time to understand
how the different files integrated with one another. However, once I created my
own layouts and added my own function, this made more sense to me. I also felt
more comfortable using the Log information for debugging.
